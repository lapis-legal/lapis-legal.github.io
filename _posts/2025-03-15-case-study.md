# Case Study: How Davis Law Tripled Their Caseload

## About Davis Law

Davis Law Group is a mid-sized personal injury firm based in Chicago, with 12 attorneys and 18 support staff. Founded in 2010, the firm specializes in motor vehicle accidents, workplace injuries, and medical malpractice cases. Before implementing Lapis Legal AI, the firm handled approximately 120 active cases at any given time.

## The Challenge

Like many personal injury firms, Davis Law faced several persistent challenges:

- **Document Overload**: Medical records, police reports, and insurance documents were overwhelming staff
- **Case Bottlenecks**: Cases would stall while waiting for document review and analysis
- **Missed Insights**: Important contradictions and supporting evidence were sometimes overlooked
- **Costly Expert Review**: Medical experts were charging substantial fees for record summaries
- **Client Communication Delays**: Case updates were time-consuming to prepare

## The Solution

In early 2024, Davis Law implemented Lapis Legal AI, focusing initially on three key components:

1. **Document Analysis**: Automated processing of medical records, incident reports, and witness statements
2. **Timeline Analysis**: AI-generated chronologies with contradiction highlighting
3. **Client Intelligence Dashboard**: Comprehensive case overview with strength assessment

## Results

After one year of using Lapis Legal AI, Davis Law reported remarkable improvements:

### Efficiency Gains
- **75% reduction** in time spent processing and analyzing medical records
- **68% reduction** in time spent creating case chronologies
- **82% reduction** in document organization time

### Case Handling Capacity
- Increased active caseload from 120 to 370 cases (308% increase)
- Reduced case processing bottlenecks by 85%
- Decreased time to case resolution by 40%

### Financial Impact
- 245% increase in firm revenue
- 70% reduction in outsourced medical record review costs
- 35% improvement in settlement values
- ROI of 580% in the first year

## Workflow Transformation

### Before Lapis Legal AI

A typical case workflow for Davis Law previously included:

1. Manual sorting and organization of medical records (15-20 hours)
2. Manual creation of medical chronology (8-10 hours)
3. Attorney review of organized records (6-8 hours)
4. Manual identification of key facts and issues (4-5 hours)
5. Creation of settlement demand (5-7 hours)

### After Lapis Legal AI

The transformed workflow now includes:

1. Bulk upload of medical records to Lapis Legal (15 minutes)
2. AI-generated medical chronology review and refinement (1-2 hours)
3. Attorney review of AI-analyzed records with highlighted key issues (2 hours)
4. Review of AI-identified contradictions and supporting evidence (1 hour)
5. Creation of settlement demand using AI-generated insights (2 hours)

## Looking Forward

Building on their success, Davis Law is now exploring additional capabilities:

- Integration with court filing systems
- Expanded use of deposition tools
- Implementation of client portal features

"The transformation has been nothing short of remarkable," says Sam Davis, founder. "We're handling three times the caseload with the same team, delivering better results for our clients, and our attorneys actually get to go home at reasonable hours."
