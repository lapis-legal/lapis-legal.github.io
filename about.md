# About Lapis Legal AI

## Our Mission

At Lapis Legal AI, we're on a mission to transform the legal industry through the power of specialized artificial intelligence. We believe that legal professionals should spend their valuable time on strategic thinking and advocacy—not on tedious document review and manual information extraction.

Our platform drastically reduces the time and effort required to process and analyze legal cases, allowing attorneys and legal staff to focus on what matters most: serving their clients with excellence.

## Our Story

Lapis Legal AI was founded by a team of legal technology experts, practicing attorneys, and AI specialists who recognized a fundamental problem in the legal industry: despite enormous technological advances in other fields, legal professionals were still spending countless hours on manual document review, information extraction, and case organization.

The team set out to build a solution that would specifically address the unique challenges of legal case management—not just a general-purpose AI tool, but a comprehensive platform designed from the ground up for legal applications.

After years of development and collaboration with legal professionals across different practice areas, Lapis Legal AI was born—a revolutionary platform that leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically trained for legal applications.

## Our Technology

What sets Lapis Legal AI apart is our specialized approach to legal AI:

- **Legal-Tailored Models**: Our AI models are trained specifically on millions of legal documents for superior understanding of legal terminology, document structure, and reasoning patterns.

- **Comprehensive Workflow Integration**: Rather than offering isolated point solutions, we've built a complete platform that integrates with every stage of case management.

- **Practice-Specific Capabilities**: We've designed features for different legal practice areas, from personal injury to corporate legal departments.

- **Human-Centered Design**: Our platform was built with continuous input from practicing attorneys to ensure it fits seamlessly into real-world legal workflows.
