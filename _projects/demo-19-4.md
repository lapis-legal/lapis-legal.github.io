The Alpine Heights Resort project represents a new paradigm in mountain hospitality architecture, where luxury amenities coexist harmoniously with environmental stewardship. Located at 2,800 meters above sea level, the resort comprises a main lodge and 12 private chalets, all designed to maximize views while minimizing environmental impact.

Each structure was carefully positioned to preserve existing tree lines and wildlife corridors, with buildings following the natural contours of the mountain. The design incorporates extensive use of local stone and timber, with large windows that blur the boundary between interior and exterior spaces.

The architectural language draws inspiration from traditional alpine shelters but reinterprets these forms through a contemporary lens. Steep roof pitches efficiently shed snow while photovoltaic tiles generate power. The building envelope employs triple-glazed windows and advanced insulation systems to maintain comfort while minimizing energy consumption.

Interior spaces feature a material palette of local granite, reclaimed wood, and natural textiles, creating warm, inviting environments that complement the dramatic mountain views. The resort's restaurants, spa, and common areas were designed to foster a sense of community while providing intimate spaces for relaxation and contemplation.
