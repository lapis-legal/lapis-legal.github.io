The Memphis Design revival project for Retro Industries aimed to create a bold, contemporary brand identity that pays homage to the iconic 1980s Memphis Group aesthetic while maintaining relevance for today's digital-first audience. Our challenge was to balance nostalgic design elements with modern applications and ensure consistent brand implementation across physical and digital touchpoints.

We began by researching the original Memphis Design movement, identifying key characteristics - geometric shapes, bold colors, asymmetric patterns - that could be adapted for contemporary use. The resulting design system captures the playful, energetic spirit of Memphis while providing the flexibility needed for diverse applications.

The new identity has helped the client differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace, with post-launch metrics showing increased brand recognition and engagement, particularly among younger audiences who are discovering Memphis Design for the first time.
