This collection of motion design pieces explores the intersection of brand identity and kinetic typography, pushing the boundaries of how logos and visual systems can exist in motion. Each piece in the collection was developed as part of a larger exhibition for the Digital Arts Festival, showcasing different approaches to bringing static design elements to life.

The work encompasses a range of styles and techniques, from geometric abstraction to fluid organic movements. We focused on creating cohesive systems where every element—from the micro-animations in icons to the grand gestures of full-screen transitions—works together to tell a compelling brand story.

Key aspects of the project included:

1. Development of motion principles that could be consistently applied across different brand applications
2. Creation of a modular animation system that could adapt to different aspect ratios and platforms
3. Integration of sound design to enhance the visual experience
4. Establishment of timing guidelines that ensure brand recognition even in short-format applications

The collection has been featured in multiple design publications and has influenced motion design guidelines for several major brands. Select pieces from the collection are now part of the permanent digital art collection at the Museum of Modern Design.
