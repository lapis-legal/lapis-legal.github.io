  <p>Through comprehensive user research including interviews with 24 participants, usability testing, and competitive analysis, we identified key pain points in the current application that were hindering adoption among the target demographic.</p>
  <p>Our strategic recommendations led to a 43% improvement in user engagement metrics and a 27% reduction in customer support inquiries related to navigation issues. The redesigned application launched successfully with overwhelmingly positive user feedback, particularly highlighting the intuitive onboarding process that we developed based on our research findings.</p>

Our UX research and strategy project for FinTech Solutions aimed to identify barriers to adoption and engagement among millennial users. The client's existing application, while feature-rich, was struggling with user retention and high abandonment rates during the onboarding process.

We conducted a multi-phase research study including contextual inquiries, remote usability testing, and diary studies to gain deep insights into how users interact with financial tools in their daily lives. This comprehensive approach revealed several critical findings:

1. Users were overwhelmed by financial jargon and complex graphs during their first interaction with the application
2. The mental models of inexperienced investors didn't align with the application's information architecture
3. Key features that users valued most were buried several layers deep in the navigation

Based on these findings, we developed a strategic roadmap for the product team, including a revised information architecture, simplified onboarding flow, and personalized dashboard concepts that would adapt to users' financial literacy levels and goals.
