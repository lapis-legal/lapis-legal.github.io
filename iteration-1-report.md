### Overall Site Structure
The Lapis Legal AI website is a Jekyll-based site for a legal tech company offering AI-powered case management and document review services. The site has several key sections including Features, Solutions, Resources, Pricing, and About, but is currently experiencing significant navigation and resource loading issues.

### Page-by-Page Analysis

#### Homepage
- **Content**: Features a hero section with "AI-Powered Legal Intelligence at Your Command" tagline, feature highlights (Native PDF Processing, 9 Extraction Types, Smart Document Splitting, Enterprise Security), metrics (500+ Law Firms, 80% Average Time Savings, SOC 2 Type II Certified, 99.9% Uptime SLA), and core capabilities section.
- **Critical Issues**:
  - Missing main navigation menu - no way to navigate to other sections
  - Missing CSS resources (404 errors for navy.css and urbanist.css)
  - Missing image resources (404 errors for dashboard-preview.webp)
  - "Sandbox" text appears in the top left instead of the company logo

### Accessibility Observations

  - Screen reader users would struggle to navigate the site

### Page Load Performance
- **Issues**:
  - Multiple 404 errors for missing resources

## Prioritized Improvement Plan

### Critical Issues (Highest Priority)

1. **Fix Missing Navigation Menu**
   - **Problem**: The main navigation menu defined in _data/navigation.yml is not being rendered on any page
   - **Impact**: Users cannot navigate the site effectively, severely limiting usability
   - **Solution**: Investigate and fix the header component to properly render the navigation menu
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Check _includes/components/header/ files for issues
     - Ensure navigation data from _data/navigation.yml is being properly loaded
     - Fix any template issues preventing the menu from rendering

2. **Fix Missing CSS Resources**
   - **Problem**: Critical CSS files (navy.css, urbanist.css) are missing or have incorrect paths
   - **Impact**: Site appears unstyled and lacks proper visual design
   - **Solution**: Create or fix paths to the missing CSS files
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Check if the files exist in assets/css/colors/ and assets/css/fonts/
     - Create the files if missing or fix the paths if they exist elsewhere
     - Update references in templates if needed

3. **Fix Missing Image Resources**
   - **Problem**: Image files like dashboard-preview.webp are missing or have incorrect paths
   - **Impact**: Placeholder images or empty spaces appear instead of actual content
   - **Solution**: Add the missing images or fix their paths
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Check if the images exist in assets/img/
     - Add placeholder images if the originals are not available
     - Update image paths in templates if needed

### Secondary Issues (Medium Priority)

4. **Fix "Sandbox" Text in Header**
   - **Problem**: "Sandbox" text appears instead of the company logo/name
   - **Impact**: Affects branding and professional appearance
   - **Solution**: Replace with proper company name or logo
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Identify where the "Sandbox" text is defined
     - Replace with proper company name or logo reference

5. **Improve Breadcrumb Navigation**
   - **Problem**: Breadcrumb navigation is the only way to navigate on some pages
   - **Impact**: Limited navigation options for users
   - **Solution**: Enhance breadcrumb visibility and ensure consistency across pages
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Check breadcrumb implementation in templates
     - Ensure all pages have consistent breadcrumb navigation

## Implementation Plan
